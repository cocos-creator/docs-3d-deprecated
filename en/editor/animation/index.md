# The Animation system

This chapter will introduce the __Animation System__ of __Cocos Creator 3D__. In addition to *standard displacement*, *rotation*, *zoom animation* and *sequence frame animation*, this __Animation System__ also supports *arbitrary component attributes* and *user-defined attributes*.  Plus the time of arbitrary editing curves and innovative mobile trajectory editing functions enable content producers to create delicate, yet, dynamic effects without writing a line of code.

> **Note**: __Cocos Creator 3D__'s built-in __Animation Editor__ is suitable for making less complex animations that need to be linked with logic, such as __UI animations__.
