![main](index/main.jpg)

The **Console** display errors, warnings, or other log information generated by the editor and engine. Information of different levels of importance are displayed.

## Abourt log
The log system is based on the `js` **console** model. When the editor is running, logs will be captured and printed out to the **console** in each process and distinguishes them by color.

  - **Log** (__console.log__): <font color=#b6b6b6>This is gray text</font>, editor messages and developer output are likely to be printed to the **console**.
  - **Warn** (__console.warn__): <font color=#ebbe09>This is yellow text</font>, when the program is running, abnormal situations that do not affect the program's result are encountered and outputted.
  - **Error** (__console.error__): <font color=#dd3c43>This is red text</font>, abnormal situations that will affect the result, a problem that must be resolved, or an uncaught error message.
